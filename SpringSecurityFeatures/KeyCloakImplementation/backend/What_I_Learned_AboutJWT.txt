JWT has 3 main parts:
Header — metadata about the token and signing method

Payload — contains the claims (the actual data)

Signature — used to verify the token wasn’t tampered with

The claims live in the payload section as key-value pairs.

A JWT payload looks like this (decoded):

json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "preferred_username": "johndoe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "exp": 1687500000,
  "roles": ["USER", "ADMIN"]
}
Each key-value pair here (sub, email, roles) is a claim.
