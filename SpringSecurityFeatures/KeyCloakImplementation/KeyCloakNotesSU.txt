# Make sure once you get the container running, you can access it at localhost:9090

# then to access the admin console, go to http://localhost:9090/auth/admin

# then to access the realm, go to http://localhost:9090/auth/realms/SpringBootKeycloak

# create a realm and add users to it , take note of the client id and client secret

# make users and create passwords for them and add them to the realm

# go to realm settings and find the endpoint url for open id endpoint configuration

# make sure you have roles for the realms and assign roles accordingly to the users
# to note when enabling new users make sure to use http://localhost:{port}/realms/{realmName}/account
# Also make sure to always assign a seperate admin for each realm


#Lastly to add extra login options for keycloak such as github, google, facebook, etc, you can do that in the admin console
# need to configure client secrets and add them to the realm from the 3rd party login providers
